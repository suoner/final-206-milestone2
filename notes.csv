As you know, the  patient is a now *****-month-old little boy who is about 17 months status  post haplocompatible T-cell-depleted transplant from his mother for  X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.  His post-transplant course  was complicated by failure to thrive and poor weight gain.  He has also  had numerous social issues and was cared for in a ***** family for  several months.  He is now back in the care of his biological mother  since August.  His post-transplant course was also complicated by mild  skin graft-versus-host disease and now vitiligo.    INTERVAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Since we last saw the patient 2 months ago, mother reports that he has  been doing very well.  Per mother, he has had no recent illnesses or  fevers.  She denies any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  He has had no new  rashes and mom thinks that his fungal nail infection has resolved.  His  vitiligo is unchanged.  He is developing quite well and mom reports that  he does say some words.  Nutrition-wise, mother thinks that his ""
appetite  and affinity for solid foods is improving.  He continues to receive 3  cans of PediaSure per day with Beneprotein supplementation as well as  baby foods with Benefiber supplementation.  Mom is also trying to add  extra calories, such as ***** or ***** oil.  His weight is up 0.65 kg  on today's visit.  He continues to receive his subcu gamma globulin  weekly without problems.  All other systems were reviewed and are  negative.    SOCIAL HISTORY:  Currently the patient has been seeing his father twice a week for a  4-hour period.  They did do a trial weekend stay; however, reportedly  the patient lost weight over the weekend and so weekend visits with his  father were banned.  Per mother, CCS is wondering if BMT would approve  another trial with his father overnight.  The patient continues to get  weighed weekly at his primary care physician's office per CCS request.    FAMILY HISTORY:  Remarkable for an older brother with X-linked severe combined  immunodeficiency who is also status post haplocompatible stem cell  transplant.    ALLERGIES:  PENTAMIDINE.    CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1.  Lamisil one-third packet p.o. daily.  2.  Ketoconazole topically to scalp every other day.  3.  Desonide ointment to vitiligo daily.  4.  Aquaphor p.r.n.  5.  Bicitra 7 mEq by mouth twice a day.  6.  *****-Vi-***** 1 mL p.o. daily.  7.  Subcu gamma globulin weekly.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 36.5, pulse 125, blood pressure 116/59, oxygen  saturation 99%, respiratory rate 32, weight of 9.4 kg, height of 77 cm.    GENERAL:  This is a small-for-age, active little toddler running around  in no acute distress.  He is alert and interactive.  HEENT:  Head is normocephalic and atraumatic with areas of unpigmented  hair.  He has clear rhinorrhea and intermittent cough on today's  examination.  He has moist mucous membranes.  There is no leukoplakia or  oral lesions.  His extraocular movements are intact.  Pupils are ""
equal  and reactive to light bilaterally.  Tympanic membranes are clear  bilaterally.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  CARDIAC EXAMINATION:  Remarkable for a September 17 harsh systolic murmur but  normal rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.  He  has a small umbilical hernia.  GENITOURINARY EXAMINATION:  Deferred.  EXTREMITIES:  Thin but warm and well perfused.  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  Grossly intact with normal gait.  I did not hear him  say any words today.  SKIN:  Remarkable for diffuse vitiligo, primarily affecting his trunk  and scalp.  His nail is still slightly erythematous but does not appear  fungal in nature.    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  In summary, this is a now *****-month-old little boy who is status post a  haplocompatible T-cell-depleted transplant from his mother at 1 month of  age for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.  His main issue post  transplant has been failure to thrive.  His issues today are as follows:      1.  Severe combined immunodeficiency disease, status post  haplocompatible stem cell transplant:  The patient has demonstrated full  T-cell reconstitution.  He does not yet have B-cell function, and we  will recheck his IgA, IgM and isohemagglutinin titers today.  He  therefore continues on weekly subcutaneous gamma globulin.  His most  recent engraftment was in June 2011 that showed 96% donor in the  CD3 lineage.    2.  Failure to thrive and weight loss:  The patient has a very prolonged  history of poor weight gain, and this struggle has resulted in *****  involvement and ***** care.  The patient is now back in mother's care  full time, and we are very encouraged that he seems to have been gaining  weight recently.  We are somewhat concerned that he has not gained any  linear height in the past 2 months, so we continue to be vigilant about  his growth.  Nutrition had a long visit with patient today, and we will  plan on either ""
increasing his PediaSure to 1.5 concentration or possibly  switching him over to Boost ***** ***** to make sure he does not get  too much protein.  We again reiterated the importance of high-calorie  foods as well as using great patience with the patient as he does  require persistence to feed him.  Regarding mom's questioning on whether  our BMT team felt it was safe to let the patient stay overnight with his  father, given the history of weight loss while in his care, we think  that this would be reasonable to retry this visitation schedule when he  is at minimum at 5th percentile for his height and weight.  He is  currently less than 5th percentile, but his most recent weight gain is a  significant improvement, and we hope that this will continue.    3.  Vitiligo, history of fungal infection:  The patient continues to be  followed by Dermatology and has an appointment with them today.  He  continues to apply steroid ointment to his vitiligo and we hope that  Dermatology will be discontinuing some of his fungal medications today  now that his fungal infection seems to have resolved.    4.  Low bicarbonate, history of renal tubular acidosis:  The patient  continues to require some bicarbonate supplementation and, in fact, the  etiology of his bicarbonate wasting is unclear, though he did at one  time have a probable renal tubular acidosis related to his medications.  We will recheck his electrolytes today and if his bicarbonate has  improved, then we can consider decreasing or discontinuing his Bicitra.  Until then, he continues on supplementation.    5.  Post-transplant immunodeficiency:  The patient has full T-cell  reconstitution but has not restored B-cell function.  He continues on  weekly subcutaneous gamma globulin.  We will recheck his B-cell function  today.    6.  Followup:  We will plan to see the patient again in 3 months' time.  Until then, he will continue to have close followup with ""
his  pediatrician.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns.    *****,      ***** *****. *****, MD  PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS  CHIEF BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT DIVISION    EXTRA COPIES:    CARBON COPIES:              ***** ***** *****, MD                              ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****                              ***** ***** *****-*****          DICTATED BY:                 ***** *****. *****, MD *****                                       ____________________________    ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:        ***** *****. *****, MD *****                                   Electronically Signed by                               ***** *****. *****, MD 11/22/2011 11:42 A                               ____________________________    D:    11/20/2011 01:01 P  T:    11/21/2011 12:40 A mq  CS#: *****  ""

Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction.     It is a pleasure to see ***** ***** ***** ***** y.o. male in Structural Cardiology Clinic for initial visit regards to PFO and tricuspid regurgitation      Past Congenital History:    HPI:    Had fever of unknown origin for 2 months. Developed PE, which was ***** found to be secondary to Tricuspid endocarditis on TTE in July with septic emboli to the lungs    Incidentally found to have a PFO on his TEE 07/26/2020 with tricuspid mass consistent with endocarditis and mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Blood cultures grew S. Mitis. Origin of endocarditis is not known. He was treated with ceftriaxone switched to Penicillin IV due to possible allergic reaction.    Since he completed his treatment, he has been feeling well. Sometimes has days with fatigue and occasional palpitations.    Was working out 3-4 hours per day. Not back to physical activity. Able to walk 4-6 miles per day and biking 15 miles. Has not gotten back to lifting weights. Has varicose veins and uses compression.     Has POTS and feels lightheaded at times and had fainting episodes in the past thought to be related to vasovagal syncope. ""
management of the patient. I agree with the findings and care plans as documented.  My additional findings/comments are:  I had a detailed discussion with Mr. *****. He is currently doing well from a cardiac perspective. Given his risk for endocarditis is higher and the risk of stroke with any paradoxical embolism he is keen to consider device closure of his PFO which is quite reasonable. We will plan to proceed with PFO device closure to reduce future risk of paradoxical embolism.  The risks and benefits of device closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) were explained in detail to the patient.  The benefit of this procedure was explained as being able to  reduce the risk of a further stroke / thromboembolic event but not eliminate the risk . It was explained further stroke or other thromboembolic events may occur despite device closure of PFO and there may be residual intracardiac shunt despite device closure of PFO.  The risks of the procedure were explained,  including but not limited to stroke, myocardial infarction, bleeding including that of the access and other sites, device embolisation, need for emergency cardiac / vascular surgery and risk to life.  It was explained based on assessment during cardiac catheterisation device closure of the device may not be proceeded with or may not be successful even if a device were to be deployed and may require device retrieval via a transcatheter or surgical approach.  The use of transesophageal / intracardiac echo during the procedure was also explained as was the need to use local or general anesthesia as appropriate. The need for dual antiplatelet therapy for six months was also explained.     Thank you very much for referring this patient and involving me in this patient's care. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.      ***** ***** *****, MD  12/07/2020        Sincerely,        ***** ***** *****, MD    Electronically ""

The patient's blood pressure was 128 mmHg/75 mmHg during the study. The heart rate ""
during the study was 74. Color Flow Doppler was utilized for this exam. Spectral Doppler was utilized for this exam.  1. The left ventricular volume is normal. LV function is normal. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 65 to 70%. There is no left ventricular hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities present.  2. The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal.  3. Left atrial size is normal. Right atrial size is normal.  4. The tricuspid leaflets are thickened. There is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.  5. There is Doppler evidence of impaired LV relaxation. LV filling pressure is likely normal.  6. The RV systolic pressure is estimated to be 37 mmHg based on a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  7. No pericardial effusion noted. The inferior vena cava is less than 21 mm in diameter and collapses with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  8. Aortic root dimension is normal. passage of saline bubbles is most consistent with a PFO.                                   Previous Comparison:  Compared to the previous study on 07/25/2020, Probably ***** thickening  of the TV. Compared to the previous study on 07/25/2020, there is no  significant change.    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ***** ***** ***** is a ***** y.o. man with the following issues:    PFO (patent foramen ovale)  Had endocarditis without known source. PFO found incidentally on echo.    Although the patient has not had known stroke or ***** in the past, he had endocarditis, placing him at greater risk for endocarditis in the future. It may be worth closing the PFO to decrease his risk of systemic embolization should he have another episode of endocarditis or venous clot.     -Patient's risk for systemic embolization is increased given the patient's PFO  -patient says that he would like to proceed with closure of PFO if possible given his risk for endocarditis (risk factor is that he has ""
had a prior episode of endocarditis) to decrease potential risk for systemic embolization      Endocarditis of tricuspid valve  Symptoms have since greatly improved. He has residual mild-mod tricuspid regurgitation. Since regurgitation is not severe and he does not have signs or symptoms of heart failure, no intervention is needed at this time    -avoid heavy lifting to avoid progression of disease    Palpitations  Occasional palpitations. ***** can be performed to determine if he has significant arrhythmia    -***** home enrollment    PFO closure procedure was explained to patient and patient reports that he would like to proceed.    the diagnosis, the treatment plan and the risks and benefits of surgery.      I have reviewed and provided the following written instructions to the patient in the   After Visit Summary:   Patient Instructions   It was a pleasure to see you today in the Structural Heart Disease clinic.  .  We reviewed your echocardiogram and it shows some residual regurgitation, or leakiness of the tricuspid valve. The degree of leakiness is not severe so we would not recommend intervention.  Regarding your PFO, or small hole in the top part of the heart, it is reasonable to close given your increased risk for endocarditis. We would first like to see if it would be covered by your insurance, and then we can schedule you for the procedure     To do:  Avoid heavy lifting  Check with your insurance to determine if they will cover PFO closure       Medication changes today:  None    Symptoms  *****Please notify us of any symptoms that may be related to your heart such as chest pain, swelling, shortness of breath, palpitations or fainting.

Review of Prior Testing  DATA:  I have personally reviewed the ""
following data:     03/13/2020 MRI/MRA Head:  Brain:  1. 2 small foci of acute infarcts in the right parietal lobe. No  evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.  2. Mild generalized atrophy.    MRA:  1. Decreased flow related enhancement at the left proximal M2  branches. This is questionable artifactual. High-grade stenosis  cannot be excluded. Suggest CTA for further evaluation, as  clinically warranted.  2. Decrease of flow-related enhancement at the left distal PCA.  This may represent slow flow.     03/13/2020 Carotid Doppler:  IMPRESSION:     Soft and calcified plaquing are both present, but this does not  result in hemodynamically significant stenosis.        03/14/2020 TTE:  INTERPRETATION SUMMARY  The calculated biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%.  The left ventricular wall motion is normal.  The right ventricle is normal in size and function.  Agitated saline was injected with no evidence of shunt seen.  There is mild mitral regurgitation.  There is mild tricuspid regurgitation.  There is mild aortic regurgitation.  There is no Echo/Doppler evidence of pulmonary hypertension.     03/29/2020 *****:  INTERPRETATION SUMMARY  1.

During normal sinus rhythm, the heart rate averaged 46 bpm and   ranged from 27 bpm to 147 bpm. Overall, the heart rate averaged   49 bpm and ranged from 27 bpm to 235 bpm.    4. Significant bradyarrhythmias or pauses: were not present.    5. The patient had rare supraventricular ectopy. 19 runs of   supraventricular tachycardia were present, with the longest   lasting 20.3 secs, averaging 100 bpm. The fastest run was 6 beats   at up to 164 bpm, ""
averaging 154 bpm. The supraventricular   tachycardia was due to nonsustained atrial tachycardia.    6. The patient had rare ventricular ectopy. 1 runs of   nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were present, lasting 4   beats at up to 235 bpm averaging 189 bpm.    7. Atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred 9% burden. The longest   run lasted 1 day 5 hours.     8. The patient reported 4 triggered events and 3 diary entries.   Reported symptoms included: lightheadedness. The rhythm(s) during   those episodes were a normal sinus rhythm.      CONCLUSIONS:   1. Overall study was abnormal.  2.

After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the bilateral groins were prepared and draped, and vascular access was established using ultrasound guidance and the modified Seldinger technique. A steerable   decapolar catheter to the CS was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. The ICE catheter was used during the procedure to evaluate the position of the catheters within the left atrium and was periodically advanced into the RV to evaluate for development   of any pericardial effusion. At baseline, there was trace pericardial effusion in posterior LV and no visualized thrombus in ***** in both RVOT and PA view.      Heparin bolus and infusion were administered to achieve and maintain a goal ACT >350 seconds for the remainder of the procedure. Under fluoroscopic and ICE guidance, transseptal access to the left atrium (*****) was then obtained twice using using   ***** ***** pigtail wire - first via ***** sheath and again via ***** sheath. After carefully flushing the sheaths, the ***** ***** catheter was advanced through the ***** sheath and Biosense ***** *****/***** D/F irrigated   ablation catheter through the ***** sheath - both into the *****. The ablator and mapping catheter were advanced into the pulmonary veins.     A three-dimensional electroanatomic map of the left atrium and pulmonary vein ostia was created using the electroanatomic mapping system. Baseline voltage mapping in sinus rhythm ""
revealed a normal voltage left atrium.      Bilateral pulmonary veins were approached with a common ostium for wide area circumferential ablation (WACA) on each side. RF applications were applied based on signal attenuation and impedance drop > 10ohms; posterior wall with 40W with a target   ablation index (*****)*****-***** and anterior wall with 502 with a target ***** (*****-*****). Additional lesions were applied into anterior and posterior carina in both sides of veins. During posterior wall ablation, an esophageal temperature was continuously   monitored, and no concerning temperature rises were noted (max rise <1 degree C). High-output pacing was performed along the superior and septal aspects of the RSPV prior to RF delivery to ensure lack of proximity to the right phrenic nerve. Pace and   ablate strategy was utilized along bilateral WACA line and additional lesions were applied to the areas with capture. Following this, isolation of all four veins were confirmed with both entrance and exit block. Rapid atrial burst pacing from ***** proximal   did not induce any tachycardia.     Following this, the catheters were withdrawn to RA and ablator was advanced into His/RV base and EP study was performed.

ICE imaging showed no new pericardial fluid. Catheters were withdrawn from the body. Following 20mg protamine infusion, sheaths were withdrawn and manual pressure held to achieve hemostasis and figure of 8 sutures with stopcocks were placed in each   groin. The ""
patient was awakened and extubated without difficulty.

Right parotid pleomorphic adenoma, benign neoplasm (ICD-9 code   235.0).  2. Potential for facial nerve paralysis (ICD-9 code 351.0).  3. Status post incisional biopsy with scar potentially containing   tumor cells.    POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:    1. Right parotid pleomorphic adenoma, benign neoplasm (ICD-9 code   235.0).  2. Potential for facial nerve paralysis (ICD-9 code 351.0).  3. Status post incisional biopsy with scar potentially containing   tumor cells.    OPERATION:    1. Left revision parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection (***** *****   *****-*****) with increased difficulty, effort and time given the scar   tissue and inflammation from the previous incisional biopsy.  2. Left infraauricular skin excision 2-3 cm (***** ***** *****).  3. Left sternocleidomastoid advancement flap reconstruction of facial   contour (***** ***** *****).  4. Left upper neck adjacent tissue skin rearrangement with an   advancement flap and dog ears excised (***** ***** *****).  5. Left facial nerve monitoring for 3 hours (***** ***** ***** x3)    ANESTHESIA:  General by oral endotracheal tube.     CLINICAL INDICATIONS:  ***** ***** is a *****-year-old woman who   developed over the last year a left infraauricular and preauricular   parotid mass. The patient underwent an incisional biopsy with tumor   fragments found on pathology by a primary care physician. The patient   underwent an MRI, which showed an isolated lesion in the superficial   part of the left parotid with some skin inflammation.    INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  We excised an ***** of skin in the tract   down to the tumor. During the operation we found significant   inflammation from the previous incisional biopsy slowing our   dissection down, increasing the difficulty and effort.     We defined the facial nerve trunk and the facial nerve branches, excised the tumor   en bloc with a normal cuff of ""
tissue around it and the skin attached   to it.     At the end of the operation, the facial nerve trunk stimulated   in all branches of the face and all facial muscles moved.     Given the facial contour defect, we rotated a superiorly-based   sternocleidomastoid advancement flap into the area for better   transition from the face to the neck.     An adjacent tissue of skin rearrangement was performed bringing the infraauricular,   postauricular skin forward in an advancement style fashion to close   the defect and the dog ear inferiorly along the defect was excised.   We also excised a bit of ***** skin so the lobule would set in   nicely.     Facial nerve monitoring was used throughout the case.    PROCEDURE ***** *****:  After obtaining informed consent from the   patient, she was brought in the operating room and placed on the bed   in supine position. The patient underwent successful oral   endotracheal intubation under general anesthesia. The head of the bed   was rotated 180 degrees from the anesthesiologist. Facial nerve   monitor was set up.     We then planned out our incisions and the skin excision incision. We   injected 1:100,000 epinephrine without lidocaine into the incision   and preauricular skin. The patient was prepared and draped in the   standard sterile fashion. The surgical team scrubbed. We made an   incision along the preauricular, posttragal skin creases around the   lobule and back along the scalp and into the scalp in an oblique   fashion for our modified fishhook incision. We then performed an   elliptical incision vertically along the scar planning to incorporate   the scar with the tumor and parotid removed.     We then with skin ***** and ***** blade raised the facial skin and   neck skin flaps. We tacked these down to the drapes with elastic skin   *****. We then tacked the lobule up similarly. We then defined the   tragal cartilage from superficial to deep. We defined the ""
anterior   border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the posterior belly of   digastric. We defined the great auricular nerve. It went through the   area of scar and tumor; thus, we incised this area and did not   preserve the posterior branch. We then dissected down to the facial   nerve trunk. We dissected along the inferior branches first and then   the superior branches. The tumor was situated in between the 2 main   branches. We then dissected it off the masseter muscle. We found the   parotid duct and ligated it and then brought the tumor off en bloc   with the skin attached to it superficially. We performed irrigation   in the area and achieved hemostasis where necessary. At the junction   of the superior one-third and lower two-thirds of the   sternocleidomastoid, we incised one-half of the anterior part of the   sternocleidomastoid and then rotated it based on its attachment to   the mastoid superiorly and then to the parotid fascia we sutured into   place with 3-0 Vicryl suture in multiple spots ***** it out to   restore the facial contour. We then placed our 7-French drain out the   low posterior neck, sutured into place with 3-0 nylon suture.     We then rotated the upper postauricular neck skin   forward in a curving fashion to restore the skin defect. We then   distributed the forces along the infraauricular and postauricular   area. We excised a bit of infralobular skin to set in the lobule and   we sewed these all into place with 3-0 Vicryl suture in a simple   interrupted fashion. We then closed the skin in the preauricular area   with 3-0 Vicryl suture in a simple interrupted fashion and 5-0   running fast-absorbing gut. We closed the skin defect in the   postauricular and scalp area with 3-0 Vicryl suture in a simple   interrupted fashion and a 5-0 running suture.    All counts at the end of the case were correct.    ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   50 mL.    IV FLUIDS:  Crystalloid.    SURGICAL ""

As the needle was withdrawn from the eye, a cotton-tipped swab was rolled over the injection site to ensure hemostasis and prevent reflux. The eyelid speculum was removed. The eye was irrigated using normal saline. The eye was examined with a 20 diopter lens and an indirect ophthalmoscope immediately after the injection. At that time, there was no change in the examination compared to prior to the injection and the central retinal artery was noted to be perfused. There were no complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well.     At the end of the procedure, the patient was discharged home in ***** ***** stable condition. He was instructed to call if he is experiencing increasing pain, redness or reduced vision. He will return in 1 month for visual acuity, eye exam and February to determine if additional treatment is required.     ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 1 cc.    SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY: None.    CONDITION: Good and stable.     ATTESTATION ""

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She has nonalcoholic steatohepatitis     (NASH), stage II of IV, based upon a biopsy from May 2004.  Since     last seen, she has been asymptomatic from a hepatic point of view.  She     has had no nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.  She has had no symptoms     suggestive of decompensated liver disease.  She remains overweight.         MEDICATIONS:  These are extensive and her list seems somewhat     incomplete.  They increase Klonopin, Cogentin, Synthroid, Risperdal,     lithium, Lexapro, Prevacid, Detrol.  I have asked her to bring all of     her medications on her next visit.         ALLERGIES:  None known.         REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems x7 is negative.         PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS:  132/94, 96 per minute, 37.1.  Her     weight is 210 pounds, largely unchanged from her last visit several     months ago.     GENERAL:  She is alert and oriented x3.  She has no stigmata of chronic     liver disease.     ABDOMEN:  Unremarkable.         LABORATORY DATA:  06/09/2005:  Fasting glucose 88, ALT 168, AST     74.         ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:     1.  NASH, stage II of IV.  She has clearly developed some progressed     liver disease.  Unfortunately, she did not meet eligibility criteria for     a ""
NASH National Institutes of Health study currently enrolling at *****;     however, she can improve matters by attempting to lose some weight.     Clearly, this is a challenge in such a patient.  She has kindly     consented to participate in a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)     database.  Through this mechanism, we will continue to encourage her     with regard to better dietary habits and attempting to exercise     somewhat.  I will keep you informed of her progress.     2.  Bipolar disorder.  Her medications appear to have been recently     changed.  I have asked her to bring all of her medications on her next     visit.     3.  Hypothyroidism.  She continues on Synthroid.         DISPOSITION:  I anticipate seeing this lady back in the clinic in 6     months' time.         I do appreciate the opportunity to participate in the patient's care.     Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.         *****,         ***** *****, M.D.     ASSISTANT ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE     HEPATOLOGY ATTENDING     GASTROENTEROLOGY FACULTY PRACTICE         EXTRA COPIES:         CARBON COPIES:         DICTATED BY:                 ***** *****. *****, MD *****                                      Electronically Signed by                                  ***** *****. *****, MD 09/21/2005 17:19                                   ______________________________     ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:        ***** *****. *****, MD *****         D:   09/16/2005 11:10 A     T:   09/20/2005  8:***** ***** *****  *****#: *****    ""

The procedure was aborted but ***** continued  to have residual lower extremity weakness, right greater than left.  He also initially  had some weakness in both upper extremities, altered sensation, and bowel and bladder  involvement requiring catheterization.  These symptoms resolved per *****'s parents.  ***** was fitted with a TLSO brace with a right hip component fixed in 25  flexion  which he must use at all times when he is out of bed.  He was transferred to  Children's Hospital ***** for inpatient rehabilitation         Past Medical History: ***** Syndrome (MPS 
 Type 1), cognitive delays, s/p bone marrow  transplant 2007, graft vs. host disease 2007, IgA deficiency, s/p multiple  orthopedic procedures including six spine surgeries and bilateral hip procedures,  asthma     Prior Level of Function: Ambulatory without device, able to run, climb  stairs, able to self-feed, personal hygiene with lots of prompting, toilet  trained but needed assist with wiping     Social History:  Lives with parents in *****. No siblings.  In special ed.      General Observations: dysmorphic features compliant with ***** Syndrome, usually says  'I don't want to' when he sees this PT. Must wear the TLSO when out of bed.  ***** had  a difficult time participating in physical therapy due to behavior problems. He  refuses to participate at times and hits and screams.  In spite of different  approaches taken, it was quite difficult to modify *****'s behavior and motivate him to  participate.      Range of Motion:  Has elbow flexion contractures.  Multiple range of motion  limitations due to *****'s Syndrome but still within functional limits.      Strength: No formal manual muscle testing completed due to cognitive delays and  decreased cooperation. Able to lift both upper extremities against gravity.  Able to  move both lower extremities against gravity in supine. No test in prone.                                  Motor Control: Appears to have isolated motor control     Tone: no spasticity or clonus noted     Balance: Fair sitting balance - limited by TLSO with right hip locked in 25  flexion.  Fair standing balance.      Sensation:  no formal test due to cognitive deficits but no complaints of numbness or  tingling        Functional Mobility: Amount of assistance required is inconsistent and depends on  patient's behavior and cooperation.   *****: supine to side in bed with railing, contact guard assist at best. *****  required to don TLSO. Patient is dependent to don/doff brace  Supine to 
 sit: Maximal assistance with TLSO on.  When patient motivated, he is able to  transition sit to supine with as little as minimal assistance  Sit to stand:  from bed, wheelchair, or commode to FWW with maximal assistance.  When  motivated, can transition with as little as minimal assistance.   Ambulation: with FWW and TLSO on for a distance of 30 feet indoors, contact guard  assistance.  Able to ambulate outside on sidewalk with FWW and TLSO, 30 feet, minimal  assistance.   Stairs:  up and down four steps x 2 with both hands on one railing, step-to, minimal  assistance.   Wheelchair propulsion: able to propel slowly with supervision x 100 feet; speed is not  very functional        Patient and Caregiver Education: *****'s parents were educated on multiple occasions  for equipment use, safety, assisting ***** with mobility, activity restrictions, and  spine precautions.  They were able to provide good return demonstration for everything  they were educated for.  They were instructed in use of the TLSO including:  don and  doff in supine, check skin for signs of pressure/irritation when brace is removed, and  wear whenever out of bed.  They were informed of spine precautions: no rotation (log  roll), no hip flexion greater than 90 , keep spine in neutral and head of bed less  than or equal to 45  when in bed.  They were also instructed in assisting ***** with  mobility including: log rolling in bed, transitions from supine to sit, transitions  sit to stand using a gait belt,  guarding ***** during ambulation with a FWW and gait  belt, and guarding ***** on stairs with a gait belt.  They were also instructed in  assisting ***** with a car transfer. *****'s parents were able to provide good return  demonstration.       Equipment Needs and Recommendations: ***** was discharged to home with his TLSO, a FWW,  a rental reclining wheelchair, and a bedside commode.  Recommendations were made for  outpatient physical therapy to continue 
 to work on strength and functional mobility.      Assessment: ***** is a *****-year-old boy with ***** Syndrome who was undergoing  scoliosis repair T5-L5 when there was a loss of MEPs and the procedure was  discontinued.  He presented with weakness in his lower extremities post-operatively  and was admitted for inpatient rehabilitation. ***** made good progress during his  rehabilitation stay.  He ***** to get out of bed with assistance and walk short  distances with a FWW while wearing his TLSO.  He continues to have weakness in his  lower extremities, in the right more than the left. He also has functional limitations  due to the TLSO which restricts spine and right hip range of motion. He is expected to  continue to make progress with outpatient physical therapy but his goals will be  limited by his brace, spinal precautions, and behavior.          ***** *****                         ***** signed    06/12/13     1344                                                                                                       The pediatric medical center for ***** California                     ***** ***** *****, *****, ***** *****-*****

DATE OF OPERATION:  05/18/2020      PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:   1.  Down syndrome.   2.  Secondary pulmonary hypertension.   3.  Status post ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure.      POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:   1.  Down syndrome.   2.  Secondary pulmonary hypertension.   3.  Status post ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure.      OPERATION:   1. Right heart catheterization.   2.  Right femoral arterial line placement.   3.  Vasodilator testing with oxygen and nitric oxide.      ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation per anesthesia record.      CLINICAL INDICATIONS:  The patient is an *****-year-old girl was born in the Philippines. She was found to have a VSD at birth. There it was felt that the defect would likely close on its own, and she did not undergo surgery. The family moved to ***** ***** years later, when she was found to have a moderate-to-large VSD with pulmonary hypertension. She was begun on sildenafil and ambrisentan and underwent a catheterization in December 2016. At that time, we found that she had a resting pulmonary arterial pressure of 80/40 and a mean of 60, pulmonary blood flow of 5.1, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 9.3. She was placed on triple therapy including subcutaneous Remodulin with post therapy cardiac catheterization showing a ""
marked reduction of her pulmonary vascular resistance to 4.2 ***** at last cardiac catheterization on 01/05/2019 with an increase in her shunt. She thus underwent repair in July of last year. She tolerated it well and has been maintained on triple therapy. She returns for cardiac catheterization now to evaluate her pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity, still on triple therapy.      PROCEDURE:  After sedation and local Xylocaine anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped. Cardiac catheterization was performed initially with the patient spontaneously breathing room air with CPAP as outlined in the anesthesia record. Vascular entry was by the percutaneous technique, and the patient was heparinized. Monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ECG, continuous pulse oximetry, and cycled cuff blood pressures in addition to intravascular pressures.      We placed a 3-French cannula in the right femoral artery for continuous pressure and intermittent blood gas monitoring. ***** percutaneous entry and a 6-French sheath, a 6-French wedge catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein and advanced to the inferior vena cava, right atrium, and superior vena cava. It was withdrawn to the right atrium and advanced across the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle and main and bilateral branch pulmonary arteries to the wedge position. We exchanged it for a 6-French thermodilution catheter for cardiac index measurements. After baseline measurements, we repeated the study using a nonrebreathing mask with 100% oxygen and 40 parts/million of nitric oxide. No angiograms were performed.      Following measurements in nitric oxide and oxygen, the nitric oxide was weaned while we monitored pulmonary arterial pressures. Thereafter, the catheter, sheath, and cannula were removed, and topical pressure was applied for hemostasis. The patient was taken to the Pediatric CICU for recovery.      DISCUSSION:  Oxygen ""
consumption was back calculated to be normal at 133 mL of oxygen/min/sq *****. ***** vena caval saturations were mildly decreased but they increased to normal values into the pulmonary artery due to admixture with higher saturated inferior vena caval flow. There was no evidence of residual left-to-right shunt. Left-sided saturations were mildly decreased due to upper airway obstruction, at 89%, and the blood gas showed a pH of 7.28, a ***** of 48, a pO2 of 67, and a base deficit of -5.      Right atrial phasic and mean pressures were mildly elevated with an A-wave similar to right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Right ventricular peak systolic pressure was mildly elevated, and there was no change into the bilateral branch pulmonary arteries. Bilateral branch pulmonary arterial phasic and mean pressures were elevated with the right being 58/26 with a mean of 41. ***** pressures were also elevated at September 14, and systemic arterial pressures were normal.      Cardiac index was normal at 3.8 L/min/sq M, and pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated, at 7.8 indexed resistance units.      During inhalation of 100% oxygen and 40 parts/million of nitric oxide, her right femoral arterial blood gas showed a pH 7.35, a ***** of 43, a pO2 of 386, and a base deficit of -2. There was a similar increase in systemic venous saturation to 84% in the pulmonary artery. There was a slight decrease in mean PA pressures to 35 mmHg with ***** of 13 mmHg. Cardiac index decreased slightly to 3.0 L/min/sq M, and pulmonary vascular resistance was essentially unchanged, at 7.3 indexed resistance units.      MANAGEMENT:  The patient was taken to the Pediatric Cardiac ICU for further recovery. We will discuss these findings with the pulmonary hypertension team and her parents, and further care and decisions regarding her pulmonary hypertension therapy will be made thereafter.

Prior to the surgery I discussed the nature of the total knee replacement surgery including alternatives to surgery and the purpose of, and ""
indications for proceeding with surgery. I discussed that this is an elective operation and that the patient should carefully weigh their options before proceeding with surgery. I discussed that this surgery is a shared decision ***** the patient and the surgeon.     I discussed the risks and benefits of surgery including, but not limited to:   bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels and resultant   complications from this, thigh numbness, blood clots and pulmonary embolism,   need for blood or blood product transfusion and transmission of disease from   these, fracture, leg length discrepancy, stiffness, failure of the implant   from wear, fracture, or metal complications, and need to further surgery.

The surgical   site ""
was confirmed by the patient and marked by the surgical team. The patient   was then given the opportunity to ask any further questions and all questions   were answered. The consent was confirmed and the risks were again   reviewed. The patient wished to proceed with the procedure. The   patient was then taken to the Operating Room where anesthesia was   induced by the anesthesia team without complication.     Positioning:   The patient was then transferred to the operating table and placed supine. All   extremities were well padded to ensure adequate protection. ***** ***** catheter   was aseptically inserted. A tourniquet was placed on the patient's operative   upper thigh. Sequential compression devices were placed on the patient's   nonoperative extremity.     Operation:   A preoperative timeout was then performed per protocol   with all parties in agreement. The leg was then prepped and draped in   the normal sterile fashion. A final time out was performed with all   parties in agreement. A modified gap-balancing approach was utilized for the surgery. A 16 cm incision was made over the anterior   aspect of the knee just medial of midline. This was taken down   sharply through skin and subcutaneous tissue using a knife.   Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery. The capsule was   identified and a standard medial parapatellar arthrotomy was made with   a fresh knife. The knee was then brought into extension. The lateral   patellofemoral ligament incised. The knee was then brought into   flexion and patella everted. A portion of the fat pad was removed for   visualization followed by the medial synovium. The ACL was   transected using the knife. A standard medial release was performed   using electrocautery and a *****. Retractors were then placed and the   tibia was then subluxed anteriorly. The medial and lateral meniscus   and the remnants of the ACL were removed. The borders of the   tibia were cleaned and ""
the tibial resection guide was placed. A   standard tibial resection was made and checked to ensure that it was   in appropriate alignment using a tray trial and drop rod. Once this was confirmed, we turned our attention to the femur. The step ***** was used to enter the femur and the distal femoral resection guide was placed in the   intramedullary canal. Resection depth was set at 9 mm with 5 degrees   of valgus. Distal femoral resection was made after the guide had been   pinned in place. The knee was then brought into extension and the   balance checked using the sizing blocks. The alignment was again   rechecked and balance and alignment were found to be appropriate. The   knee was then brought into flexion and the gap balancing ***** was   placed. This was tensioned appropriately and stability in flexion was tested and the knee was found to be appropriately balanced. The guide was then drilled and removed and the appropriate 4-in-1 femoral cutting block was placed and checked for notching, alignment and posterior condyle resection.     The femoral cuts were then made including the anterior and posterior cuts followed by the chamfer cuts. The sizing block was removed, the notch cut guide was pinned into place, and the notch cut was made. The lamina spreader was then placed, first laterally and then medially, and the remnants of the menisci were removed posteriorly followed by osteophytes. The femoral trial was   then impacted in place and found to have an excellent fit. This was then   drilled. The tibia was then subluxed forward and the appropriately sized tibia   tray was measured and pinned into place, this was then drilled and ***** punched.     The tibial trial was then placed and the knee was brought into extension.   The knee was then checked for stability and range of motion and with   various size tibial trials, it was found to have range of motion from   0-130 degrees and be stable in full extension, ""
mid flexion, and 90 degrees of flexion to varus and valgus stress without excessive laxity to anterior drawer.   The patella was then everted and the patella resection was made freehand after a caliper confirmed appropriate thickness of the necessary patella resection. The caliper was again used to confirm appropriate thickness that remained. The button was then sized and drilled. The trial was placed, the patella was found to track appropriately.     Once we were satisfied with trialing the trials were then removed. The tourniquet was then inflated. The knee was then irrigated copiously with normal saline and dried. The drapes were changed and the entire surgical team changed their gloves. The cement was mixed. The tibial and femoral components were then was then cemented and impacted all excess cement was removed. The trial insert was placed and the knee was brought into full extension. The patellar button was then cemented into place using the patellar clamp. All excess cement was removed and the cement was allowed to *****. Once the cement was hardened, the knee was again taken through a range of motion stability to   determine the appropriate size insert and it was found to have   excellent range of motion stability as before.     The trial insert was then removed, the tibial tray was cleaned, and   the final insert was impacted into place. The knee was then again   copiously irrigated with 1 liter of dilute Betadine followed by 1   liter of normal saline. The arthrotomy was closed using 0 Vicryl   followed by an 0 V-lock. Range of motion was checked after arthrotomy   closure and was found to have range of motion from 0-130 degrees.   The deep layer was closed with 0 Vicryl, subcutaneous   layer was closed by a 2-0 ***** by a 3-0 Monocryl. Steri-   Strips were placed followed by a sterile dressing. Drapes were then   taken down. The patient was then awoken from anesthesia without complication. The ""
patient was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition. They tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. The patient's family was made aware of their condition.

Informed consent was verified, and the patient was taken to the OR and placed on the OR table in the supine position. General anesthesia was induced and the patient received IV CTX/flagyl per the primary surgery team. The patient was then repositioned in the dorsal lithotomy position with all pressure points well-padded and was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.     A well lubricated 21 Fr rigid cystoscope was inserted atraumatically into the urethra and bladder. There were no abnormalities noted in the urethra. Upon entry into the bladder, the bilateral ureteral ureteral orifices were identified in the orthotopic position. Pan-cystoscopy was performed and was unremarkable. A sensor wire was inserted into the left ureteral orifice without issue and a 5 Fr ureteral catheter was inserted over the wire and advanced to 22cm. This passed without issues. The scope was removed leaving the 5 Fr catheter in place.     A 16 Fr foley catheter was inserted into the bladder and the 5 Fr catheter ***** secured to ""
the foley in two places using 2-0 ***** ties. The foley and ureteral stent were connected to drainage bags.    The patient was then turned over to the primary team.

The left ventricular volume is mildly increased. LV function is borderline to mildly decreased. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 50 to 55%. There is upper limits of normal to borderline increased left ventricular mass by index. There is   hypokinesis of the apical lateral wall of the left ventricle.  2. The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal.  3. There is mild left atrial enlargement. Right atrial size is normal.  4.  Aortic Valve: A percutaneous stented bioprosthesis is present in the aortic position. The peak and mean transvalvular gradients are 24 mmHg and 15 mmHg, respectively. There appear to be two paravalvular regurgitation jets, one posterior and   contacting the anterior mitral valve leaflet, and the other at the anterior aspect of the valve. The overall regurgitation severity is mild. The aortic prosthesis is not well visualized. The prosthetic valve is well seated.  Mitral Valve: The mitral valve leaflets are thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate mitral valve stenosis. The peak and mean transvalvular gradients are 14 mmHg and 6 mmHg, respectively. Mild mitral regurgitation is   present. Gradients were obtained at heart rate 73 bpm.  5. Mitral stenosis precludes the accurate evaluation of diastolic function.  6. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure is estimated to be 53 mmHg based on a right atrial pressure of 15 mmHg. PASP is moderately elevated (40-60).  7. A trace pericardial effusion is noted. The pericardial effusion appears to be free-flowing. The inferior vena cava is greater than 21 mm in diameter and collapses less than 50% with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 15 mmHg.  8. Aortic root dimension is normal.

Azithromycin and Montelukast were discontinued in 2017, her lung function remained stable, and there was no evidence for BO on most recent CT scan in 2018. She has had improvement in obstructive and restrictive lung disease over time.  She continues on Symbicort for bronchodilator-responsive airflow obstruction and history of wheezing with colds, consistent with asthma. Her symptoms have improved with Symbicort. She uses Xopenex instead of Albuterol due to history of right bundle branch block s/p TAPVR repair.     She developed pulmonary aspergillosis in September 2014 and was taken off antifungal therapy in September 2015, and continued on fungal prophylaxis. Her chest CT indicates scarring in the previous area of infection in the left lower lobe.    Her spirometry continues to show mild lung restriction, most likely due to deconditioning. She does not have evidence for pulmonary GVHD on serial chest CT's.

Also known as being a """"night *****"""".  In general people find it easier to go to bed later vs earlier due to our circadian rhythms, which includes when melatonin is secreted.  (this is why it is easier to travel west vs east).  Melatonin is present in the brain as it gets dark, and goes away with light.  With DSPS your melatonin is being released too late, and turned off too late and that is why it is hard to go to bed early.  Of note, sedatives typically don't work as they will not override the circadian alerting signal.  With the instructions below, we can gradually shift your circadian rhythms so that you can go to bed earlier.      Keep a consistent bedtime and wake up time.  It is extremely important to keep a consistent bedtime and even more critical, a consistent wake up time.  You need to keep your bedtime and wake up time no more than 1 hour different.  For instance, going to bed at 1-2 am vs 1-3 am.  Gradually go to bed no more than 30 minutes earlier each week, and get up 30 minutes earlier as well.  Get up at the same time every morning whether you have slept that night or not.     Example:   Week 1:  Bedtime 2 am, wake up time 10 am    Week 2:  Bedtime 1:30 am, wake up time 9:30 am and so on    Another technique is to go to bed 3 hours later every day until you get to your goal bedtime.  Though this can be very effective, it can only be done if there are no work or school responsibilities for the week it takes to do this.    Take melatonin 0.5 mg five hours before your goal bedtime.  Since your natural melatonin is being released too late, we want to cause it to be released earlier.  Taking melatonin five hours before your bedtime makes your brain release your natural melatonin earlier.  This is a circadian rhythm shifting dose vs a sedative dose.  Set an alarm on your watch or phone to remind you to take it.  It will make you ""
more """"drowsy"""" earlier, thus making it easier to ***** asleep at an earlier time.  This may only be needed for a few months until your schedule is consistent.     Example:  If you want to go to bed at 12:00 am, take the melatonin at 7:00 pm.      Bright light therapy.    Bright light in the morning turns off your natural melatonin production.  It is important to get outside for 20-30 minutes each morning within the first hour of awakening without sunglasses (but do not stare at the sun as that will hurt the retina--ambient outdoor light is sufficient).  If this is not possible or practical, a bright light box could be purchased.  Bright light boxes that are recommended are 10,000 *****, blue light, with a UV filter.  Once again, this may be something you need to do for a few months. Also avoid outdoor light in the evening as it will delay bedtime.        You will always have the tendency to go to bed late, since it is your natural circadian rhythm, and at some point may find you bedtime is creeping later.  When you see this happening, start the above techniques again to reset your clock.       ""

had an ileostomy revision for a parastomal hernia. Here are instructions now that you are leaving the hospital.    What to expect  · Everyone recovers differently, but these are some general ideas so you can anticipate your recovery.  · Most patients find that they get tired easily after leaving the hospital. Most patients feel back to normal within a few weeks.  · Soreness across your abdomen may persist for several weeks. Take prescribed pain medication to relieve discomfort.  · It is common to feel slightly winded with activity. However, it is important that you remain active. Walking is a good exercise.  · It is normal to have a decreased or sluggish appetite. Eat small, frequent meals.    Follow-up  Dr. ***** would like to see you in 3 weeks. The office number is *****-*****-*****. You can also use UCSF MyChart to communicate with us.    MyChart is UCSF Medical Center’s patient portal. You can send messages to your provider, view your clinical lab results, request medication refills, request appointments, and more. If you have questions about your condition in the next few weeks, please send your surgeon a UCSF MyChart message.    If you need to sign up, go to *****.*****.***** and click “Request an Account”.  An activation code will be sent to you within 2 business days.    Also, please MyChart your surgeon or call the office if you develop any of the following:     • The area around your incision becomes very red, increasingly tender, or begins to drain pus.  Small amounts of blood-tinged fluid and mild redness are common and are no cause for concern.  We expect some degree of bruising around the incisions.  • Your temperature goes above 100.4° F (38.0° C).  • Persistent vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation develop.  • You feel as if you are getting sick instead of well.  • Any thought that you should contact your other doctors or should report to an emergency room for something related to the operation. Call us ""
first.    Below is the list of your upcoming follow-up appointments that are currently scheduled:  No follow-ups on file.    If you need to reschedule your appointment or if an appointment is not yet scheduled, call the office to make an appointment.    Pain  It is normal to have some pain after surgery, though you can take pain medications to help with your discomfort. It is impossible to resolve your pain completely, though your pain should be well enough controlled so that you are able to walk around.    When you leave the hospital, you should take multiple types of medications to help control your pain. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen should be enough to control the majority of your pain, though you will also be provided with a small prescription for a stronger pain medication that you should only take if your pain is not controlled by acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen. You may stop this regimen when you are having less pain. As your pain improves, we recommend that you stop any narcotic pain medications first, then stop ibuprofen, and finally stop acetaminophen last.    - Acetaminophen (Tylenol): you should get this over-the-counter if it has not been prescribed. Take 650 or 1000 mg every 6 hours for pain. Do not use more than 4,000 mg per day including this prescription and other medications that contain acetaminophen (such as Norco, Percocet, and Vicodin). You can stop taking this once your pain is gone, typically after a few days to a week.  - ***** (Advil or Motrin): you can get this over-the-counter if it has not been prescribed. Take 400 to 800 mg every 6 hours with food for pain. You can alternate this with acetaminophen or take it at the same time. Do not take more than 3,200 mg per day. You can stop taking this once your pain is gone, typically after a few days to a week.  - Gabapentin (Neurontin): take this medication as prescribed. It will help decrease pain. If you are becoming ""
confused or overly sleepy, stop using it. You can stop taking this once your pain is gone, typically after a few days to a week.      Medications  Typically you can continue any medications you were previously taking unrelated to your hospital stay/surgery. You should take your medicines exactly as prescribed. You may have new medications. We may have asked you to discontinue some of your previous medications, or change the doses. Please see the attached medication list.      Diet  Please continue a low residue diet when you return home.    Activity  It is common in the first few days to feel a little more tired than expected. It is not a problem, and is no reason to limit your activity. Just compensate by getting extra rest.  Walking is a good choice for exercise after your hospital stay.  • You may perform normal daily activities as you feel up to it.  This includes walking up and down stairs, walking outside the house, traveling as a passenger in a car or a plane, etc.  • Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you have stopped all narcotic medications for at least 24 hours, and until you feel you could respond in an emergency  • Avoid strenuous activities (sports; calisthenics; sexual intercourse) for the next few weeks. You can increase your activity as tolerated.  • Avoid straining or lifting more than 10 lb (a gallon of milk) for the next month                 Patient Instructions    None       ""

We are unable to treat this problem surgically and therefore refer to our GI colleagues for management of this problem.      #Acute hypoxia secondary to pneumonia   On POD#2, patient was noted to be febrile although he was stable on 2L nasal cannula. On POD#3, patient's oxygen requirement increased and he became acutely hypoxic and hypoxemic requiring up to 25L high flow nasal cannula. He was transferred to the ICU. CT-PE and DVT ultrasounds were negative, CXR was notable for a right basilar opacity concerning for pneumonia. He was started on Vanc/Zosyn empirically while blood and sputum cultures were sent. Respiratory therapy was consulted and the patient was started on a lung expansion pathway. On POD#5 patient's oxygen requirement decreased and he was transferred to the wards in stable condition. He was treated with a 7 day course of antibiotics (6 days of zosyn, 1 day of Augmentin) for presumed *****, although blood cultures were negative and sputum cultures were cancelled due to contamination.

In addition, the parastomal hernia has allowed her end   ileostomy to prolapse and we are him now to the operating room to   repair this.  We have discussed options and decided that it is in the   patient's best interest to re-site the hernia from the right lower   quadrant to the left lower quadrant.     PROCEDURE:  After the successful institution of a general   endotracheal anesthetic and placement of an epidural catheter for   perioperative analgesia, the patient was positioned on the operating   room table in a supine fashion.  All pressure points were checked and   padded, and the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile   fashion.  A surgical timeout was performed, and the patient was given   a perioperative dose of antibiotics for wound infection prophylaxis.    We began by exploring the patient through his previous midline   laparotomy incision.  Utilizing a combination of electrocautery and   sharp dissection, we were able to enter the abdominal cavity without   inadvertent injury to the underlying viscera.  What then ensued with   a 45 minute long lysis of adhesions separating loops of intestine   from the anterior abdominal wall and ultimately allowing us to reduce ""
  his parastomal hernia.  Part of that process included incising the   skin surrounding the stoma in the right quadrant and resecting the   prolapsed bowel, which had signs of ischemic injury, resulting in   removal of approximately 15 cm of ileum.  Once the ischemic bowel had   been removed and the bowel reduced from the previous stoma site, we   then made a new stoma in a site that had been previously marked by an   ***** therapist before the surgical procedure.  This involved   coring out a circle of skin and cylinder of underlying soft tissue   down to the level of the anterior abdominal wall fascia.  The   anterior fascia was then incised also in a circular pattern.  The   underlying rectus muscle bluntly divided, and a #25 EEA anvil stem   placed through the posterior rectus sheath.  We placed around that   stem then a 6 cm circle of soft mesh and then engaged the EEA #25   *****.  This fired without difficulty taking a circular portion of   the posterior rectus sheath out but stapling the soft mesh in a   circular pattern, reinforcing that fascial defect.  Unfortunately,   the ileum was too large to fit through this opening, and this was the   only size circular stapling device that was currently available in   the hospital.  Consequently, we cut out the stapled mesh and then   custom cut a donut of mesh around an orifice that was closer to 28 mm   to 30 mm.  This was sewn to the posterior rectus sheath with   interrupted 2-0 PDS and then trimmed to a width of approximately 1 cm   and tucked beneath the rectus muscle, followed by closure of the   posterior rectus sheath to the anterior rectus sheath thereby   enclosing the mesh in soft tissue, and ensuring that none of the mesh   would ever be in direct contact with the bowel.  The terminal ileum   was then easily brought through this fascial defect to the level of   the skin.     We then turned our attention to closure of the abdominal cavity,   which ""
was done utilizing a series of figure-of-eight #1 PDS sutures   as was the right lower quadrant stoma site closed at the level of   fascia with interrupted figure-of-eight #1 PDS sutures.  We irrigated   the subcutaneous tissue, and then placed a series of 4-0 Vicryl   subdermal sutures loosely approximating both the skin at the stoma   site and the midline before then closing the midline at the level of   the skin with staples.  We packed the right lower quadrant stoma   site.  We then placed a towel over the midline closure, and proceeded   to mature our ileostomy in a ***** fashion utilizing a series of 4-0   Vicryl sutures.  Of note, we did ***** the bowel to the fascia with a   series of interrupted 4-0 ***** sutures as a means of further   stabilizing the stoma and hopefully further reducing the chance of a   parastomal hernia.  Once the stoma had been brooked, we then placed a   1-piece stoma appliance with Mastisol.  A sterile dry dressing was   then applied to the midline and the right lower quadrant incisions,   and procedure terminated.  The patient tolerated the procedure quite   well.     ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Less than 100 mL.     SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY:  Ileostomy.     ATTENDING SURGEON:  ***** *****, MD     SURGICAL ATTENDANCE: Responsible attending ***** ***** *****. *****,   who was present throughout the entire case.     ASSISTANT SURGEON:  ***** *****, MD (chief resident)  ***** *****, MD (R4)  ***** *****, 4th year medical student        DICTATED BY: ***** *****. *****, MD   RESPONSIBLE SURGEON: ***** *****. *****, MD    DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS    Discharge Diet  Other: Low Residue Diet    Functional Assessment at *****/Activity Goals  No functional activity limits.

It is clear that he has persistent year-round symptoms due to dust ***** exposure. Given he was sensitized to only dust ***** today and dog (but does not have regular dog exposure), he is an excellent candidate for house dust ***** sublingual immunotherapy with *****. We will request prior authorization for ***** and inform him of the quote before proceeding with therapy. We did did discuss the risks and benefits of SLIT with ***** in detail. Namely, that most important risk to note is that of an allergic reaction particularly on the first dose.  · Prior auth submitted for *****  · If patient accepts cost, will need to prescribe Epi ***** and schedule first dose in clinic  · Also discussed importance of continuing a nasal steroid which will help with both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis  · ***** nasal saline rinses at least once daily; reviewed technique in detail    # Mild intermittent asthma  ***** was diagnosed with asthma years ago and no spirometry is available. He only uses inhalers during acute URIs or wildfire smoke. If symptoms become more persistent, then I would recommend spirometry and a trial of a controller inhaler. He reports that he ""
does have Symbicort at home that was prescribed accidentally instead of nasal fluticasone by another provider. I did suggest that he use Symbicort as needed 1 puff if he is noticing wheezing during URIs/wildfires up to every 4 hours.    # Penicillin allergy  ***** score = 0. Reaction was >50 years ago and consisted of skin symptoms only that did not require any immediate treatment. He is an excellent candidate to proceed directly to amoxicillin challenge. Drug allergy clinic referral placed.      Informed Consent 01/15/2022  Skin testing, Monitored Challenge (Observed Administration) and Immunotherapy was reviewed in detail, and the risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient and/or the patient's medical decision-maker.

food play such as licking or kissing foods and very able to self-initiate while remaining regulated, though playfully declining any intraoral nutritive food play.  Pt appears to be at her baseline for feeding and in the setting of her long standing oral aversion anticipate pt would benefit the most from ongoing OP feeding therapy to further overcome her oral aversion and support her ability to gradually accept tastes of foods intraorally.  Pt is on CPS hold and awaiting placement, recommend pt discharge with resumption of OP therapies (CCS for OT, PT, and feeding; please send with new referrals if indicated based on placement).  No further ***** feeding/dysphagia needs at this time, though would recommend ongoing food play experiences while pt admitted to promote ongoing interest in food play.  Pt does have some increased risks of aspiration associated with her CP and limited oral feeding skills though does self-limit and is not impulsive, though would be best as able to have supervision during food play for safety.     Feeding recommendations:  Continue with current diet and feeding plan   Offer pt regular foods and thin liquids for token tastes, but recommend avoiding ***** given pt's delayed skills for safety  Pt self-limits and is not impulsive with placing foods into mouth, but recommend for safety supervision with extraoral sensory food play  Encourage pt to self-initiate tastes of licking or kissing foods, if pt does take a bite, encourage to spit out if becomes too difficult to manage  Do not push intraoral food experiences to decreased risks of worsening oral aversion   ***** teeth before/after food play   Ensure pt is fully upright during food play  D/C if pt shows any increased s/sx of aspiration     Caregiver education/training:   No caregivers at bedside, but feeding team able to speak with caregivers when identified as needed prior to d/c    Rehab prognosis:  Rehabilitation prognosis is fair ""
